# Graph Pathfinding Algorithms

This Java project implements shortest path finding algorithms:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

## Files

- `Graph.java` â€” Main logic for graph operations
- `cop3503-asn2-input-1.txt` â€” Sample graph input
- `cop3503-asn2-output-gerber-matthew-dj-1.txt` â€” Dijkstraâ€™s output
- `cop3503-asn2-output-gerber-matthew-bf-1.txt` â€” Bellman-Ford output
- `cop3503-asn2-output-gerber-matthew-fw-1.txt` â€” Floyd-Warshall matrix (optional)
- `COP3503 Dijkstra Samples.pdf` â€” Sample walkthroughs
- `COP3503 11 Pathfinding.pdf` â€” Lecture reference

## Summary

This project was completed for COP3503 and scored **100/100** ðŸŽ‰  
It reads graph input from a file and prints shortest-path trees using multiple algorithms.
